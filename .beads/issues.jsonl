The app talks to a local WebSocket server; the server watches `.beads/issues.jsonl` and executes `bd` commands corresponding to edits from the UI.\n\nScope\n- Runs locally; no cloud dependencies\n- SPA served from localhost; WebSocket for data\n- Live updates driven by `.beads/issues.jsonl` watcher\n- Editing in UI sends WS messages; server runs matching `bd` commands\n\nNon-goals\n- Multi-user concurrency beyond a single machine\n- Authentication/authorization beyond localhost-only protections\n\nConstraints\n- ECMAScript modules; JSDoc types; `.ts` only for interface declarations\n- Follow provided Coding and Testing Standards\n- Prefer minimal dependencies; no heavy framework required\n","acceptance_criteria":"- User can view issues list and open an issue detail page.\n- User can change issue status and edit text fields (title, description, acceptance) from the UI.\n- UI changes propagate via WebSocket to a local server; server executes the corresponding `bd` command(s).\n- File watcher on `.beads/issues.jsonl` pushes updates; the on-screen issue(s) update without refresh.\n- Protocol documented (request/response + push events) with versioning and error model.\n- Local-only server binding (127.0.0.1) with basic input validation.\n- Tests cover protocol handlers and critical UI flows.\n- Quickstart docs explain setup, run, and development workflow.","notes":"Implemented local-first SPA and server with live updates and bd integration.\n\nHighlights\n- UI: Issues list and detail views (`app/views/list.js`, `app/views/detail.js`) with status and priority controls plus inline title/description editing; navigation via hash router; app shell in `app/main.js`.\n- Protocol: Documented v1.0.0 in `app/protocol.md` and shared symbols via `server/protocol.js`.\n- WS transport: Robust client with reconnect and event dispatch (`app/ws.js`); server with request/response and push events, including heartbeat (`server/ws.js`).\n- bd integration: Executes matching `bd` commands for list/show/update/edit/dep operations (`server/bd.js`, handlers in `server/ws.js`).\n- Live updates: DB watcher broadcasts `issues-changed` and SPA refreshes list/detail accordingly (`server/watcher.js`, `app/main.js`).\n- Local-only bind: Defaults to host `127.0.0.1` with configurable port (`server/config.js`).\n- Tests: 59 passing tests across app + server covering protocol handlers and critical UI flows (`npm test`).\n- Quickstart: Added `docs/quickstart.md` with setup, run, and workflow. DB watching details in `docs/db-watching.md`.\n\nNotes\n- The implementation watches the active beads SQLite DB (current beads store) rather than a historical `issues.jsonl`. The doc was updated to reflect this.\n- The UI currently supports editing title and description. If acceptance text editing is required, propose a small follow-up to extend the `edit-text` handler and UI.\n","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-10-22T09:13:34.683692+02:00","updated_at":"2025-10-24T10:24:05.159714+02:00","closed_at":"2025-10-22T15:16:15.490119+02:00"}

Configure ESLint/Prettier and type checks via `tsc`.\n- Standards: Follow project coding/testing standards provided by user instructions.\n\nHigh‑level capabilities:\n- List, filter, and sort issues.\n- View issue details including dependencies.\n- Update status and priority; edit title/description.\n- Auto‑refresh on `.beads/issues.jsonl` changes; push‑based (no polling).\n- Display ready work and basic stats.\n\nNon‑goals (initial phase):\n- Multi‑repo orchestration, auth, or remote access beyond localhost.\n- Advanced visualization (graphs) beyond simple lists/trees.\n\nWS message types (initial draft):\n- `list-issues` { filters }\n- `show-issue` { id }\n- `update-status` { id, status }\n- `edit-text` { id, field: 'title'|'description', value }\n- `update-priority` { id, priority }\n- `create-issue` { title, type, priority, description }\n- `list-ready` {}\n- `subscribe-updates` {}\n\nbd command mapping (examples):\n- list → `bd list --json [filters]`\n- show → `bd show \u003cid\u003e --json`\n- update status/priority → `bd update \u003cid\u003e --status ... | --priority ...`\n- close → `bd close \u003cid\u003e`; reopen → `bd reopen \u003cid\u003e`\n- create → `bd create \"title\" -t \u003ctype\u003e -p \u003cprio\u003e -d \"desc\"`\n- dependencies → `bd dep add|remove \u003ca\u003e \u003cb\u003e`; tree → `bd dep tree \u003cid\u003e` (optional)\n\nLive update source:\n- Observe `.beads/issues.jsonl` (JSON Lines).
